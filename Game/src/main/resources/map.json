As you rise, the softness of sand on your neck and chin quickly becomes sharp as you begin to wipe it off. As you struggle to stand and regain balance, you’re able to make out being on the shores of an unknown island. The events that led to you winding up here are unclear. What is clear however, is that your body aches and burns and that your throat stings of thirst. Looking around, you notice the cheap plastic watch you purchased a few years back from a CVS. Surrounding the timepiece (which is now cracked), is a compass tacked on as an additional selling point, the type no one ever seems to actually make use of. The time is 3:00. To the east, a few palm trees make up the entrance to an area of greenery. Directly to the west, the water of a seemingly endless ocean. (west / east)"
